Dark Souls Random Path generates a randomly ordered run through the bosses, taking into account the prerequisites of each boss

You can see the boss order [here](https://www.deviantart.com/patryk567/art/Dark-Souls-Boss-Flowchart-802512790)

I'd love to do the same for Elden Ring, once I beat the game and I can't be spoiled anymore.
